### User Stories

1. As a user I want to easily know the rules of the game

## Strategy

Memory is a classic game consisting of flipping two cards until you get a match. The game goes along until every card has been matched. This time with a theme of famous european landmarks.

## Design

The design consists of two themes. One day, one night. This to make it easier for users to play depending on the time of day, to releave stress to the eyes.
I chose the colors based on the palette of the themes background.

Considering it being a one-page site it needed to be visually pleasing the moment you enter it.

### Box Shadow

It being a "instant play" game I needed to make the grid pop. Adding the shadow behind the tiles gives them a "floating" visual.

### Planning

I wireframed it using Balsamiq.

The only thing that strayed from the initial wireframe was the addition of the two themes.
